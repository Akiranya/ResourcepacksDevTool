# ResourcepacksDevTool
Fabric mod - Handy Resourcepack tools for developer

## Requirements
- Minecraft 1.19.2
- Fabric loader >=0.14.8

## Main feature

Keeps the last loaded server resourcepack in memory even if you quit the server or you get kicked.\
This is useful to avoid wasting time while testing stuff on your own servers but also if you play on servers which require resourcepacks and you need to quit/join a lot.

## Future features

No idea, some debug tools probably.
